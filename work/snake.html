                    The Snake game is a basic demonstration of my web development skills. Looking at it now, it's a fairly simple task, but back when I was a beginner, 
                    it was quite difficult because there were many factors to consider, such as how to avoid bugs and what the best approach was to make the game. 
                    The game itself has three levels: Level 1 is an easy level, the second level adds obstacles in the snake's way, and the third level is a free-roam 
                    level where the user can play until they fail.

                    Including this project in my portfolio has been valuable, as it serves as a great showcase of my early development work. 
                    It allows for a clear comparison of where I started as a developer to where I am now. Reflecting on the challenges I faced during 
                    its creation helps me appreciate my growth and the skills I've developed since then.
